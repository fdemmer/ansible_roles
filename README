A collection of ansible roles to use primarily with vagrant.


Installation
------------

Clone the roles in this repository:

    git clone <git repo> ~/.ansible/roles

Note, that this command copies the roles to the ~/.ansible/roles directory.
This is the recommended location for shared ansible roles, but you can choose
any other location you like.

Make sure the ansible.cfg file in your project (in the root directory next to
the Vagrantfile) contains the roles_path setting:

    [defaults]
    roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles/:~/.ansible/roles/

Alternatively you can create your own configuration file in your home
directory: ~/.ansible.cfg and add that line, including your custom roles
location.


Usage
-----

Please inspect the defaults and tasks files of the roles for insights.

Primary usecase of this role collection is provisioning of Django projects
with vagrant. Typically you would start out with a site.yml like this:

    ---
    - name: provision service
      hosts: default
      become: yes
      become_user: 'root'

      vars:
        - service_name: 'foo'

      roles:
        - common
        - python
        - django
